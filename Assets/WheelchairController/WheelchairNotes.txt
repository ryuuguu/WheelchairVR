Done============
Add rig as a MoveForwardSource
find all teleport controls
move to teleport control scheme
initial calibration of forward
make trail for wheelchair movement

mask out turn from 2d vector in readinput to only return x values y = 0

notes: calibrating initial head position
VR headset sets you initial head position as straight ahead. Which is not a problem with walking avatars because the feet are assumed to to pointing where the head points feet can easy turn on the spot when standing. With a wheelchair turning you head does not automatically turn you chair and must be done using the hands. So it important to zero the head when it is facing the same direction as the wheelchair.
